# TimeApp
TimeApp is my first project created in Java. It's pretty simple and basic application 
based on timer. It consists of 4 different programs which will be briefly described below. 
The app is not very advanced visually. It might be updated later on.

### MainPanel
MainPanel is the first panel you will see when you open the application. It is the place where
you can select the program you want to use.

## Stopwatch
Stopwatch is the first part of the application I created. It is a simple program based on
Timer class. Its only functionality is to start/stop and reset the time that is counted while the
stopwatch is turned on.

## Clock 
Clock is the second part of the application that was created. It is a simple clock that is
updated every second and shows the current time and date based on the user's machine.

## Countdown
Countdown is the third of the four applications I created. In this program, the user
can enter the desired minutes and seconds and accept their value. The program will check
that the data entered is correct and will display the time on the panel. The user can start/stop and reset the timer.
I also uploaded a custom sound that turns on when the time is up.

## WorkoutTimer
WorkoutTimer is the last program included in this application. It contains two timers, one
for workout time and one for rest time. The user can enter a time for both workout and rest.
The program changes from one timer to the other when one timer runs out of time. It is looped
and also has custom sound alerts when one of the timers runs out.
